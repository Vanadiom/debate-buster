# debate-buster <br/> or <br/> 'how I learned to embrace studies to feel like I have won the debate'
This is a repository where I try to compile a bunch of studies and data for things I like to debate.

>I will scrape together peer reviewed studies and well documented articles I find on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or other places.  
You are free to contribute, It's even appreciated, remember to keep it controverstial.

The [Covid Folder](Covid/covid.md) will have a bunch of stuff about the topic, it's what I start with because "I just wanna, okay?".
