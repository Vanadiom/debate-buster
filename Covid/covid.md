## A not so comprehensive guide

> I have recently started talking about it more to friends, that say weird stuff about the 'Matrix' so I have now decided to have a compilation of *"Stuff that I might use"*  
I specifically wanted this to be backed up with studies, like actual studies, or things that directly link strudies.  
If we use non studies, they have to link directly to studies in an easy and good to see way ([for example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8056514/))

- ### Long Covid:
    I find this topic interesting, so this is what I'll start with.  
    There is this [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8056514/) that I also used as the example for a 'good' article.  
    I find it to be very comprehensive in it's information.  
    But most information will be found in the dedicated [Long Covid Folder.](LongCovid/long_covid.md)

- ### Covid Mortality:
    If you decide to talk about covid, this will come up, often as a  
    "Our reaction to Covid has been much worse than the disease itself"  
    So we should put together a bunch of studies in the [Covid Mortality Folder.](CovidMortality/covid_mortality.md)
